# agentic-ai-collections

This repository is a curated collection of applications built using agentic AI architectures. Agentic AI refers to systems designed with autonomous reasoning and decision-making capabilities, often composed of multiple interconnected components such as language models, tools, memory, and control flows. These applications demonstrate how AI agents can plan, reason, and interact with users or data sources to accomplish complex tasks autonomously or with minimal human intervention.

The primary goal of this collection is to showcase practical implementations of agentic AI across different domains, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), web search integration, data analysis, and decision routing using guardrails and supervisors. Each application demonstrates modular and reusable patterns such as agent loops, dynamic tool invocation, and conditional workflows.

Developers and researchers can explore this repository to understand how to build scalable and interpretable AI agents that go beyond single-turn prompts. It includes sample code, configurations, and deployment strategies for each use case, making it easier to adapt these agents to new environments or tasks.

Whether youâ€™re experimenting with LangGraph, LangChain, or other AI orchestration tools, this repository offers a hands-on reference to help accelerate development and experimentation with next-generation autonomous AI systems.
